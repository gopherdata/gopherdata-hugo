If you haven't heard, there is a new kid on the machine learning block named [Machine Box](https://machinebox.io/).  It's pretty cool, and you should check it out.  Machine Box provides pre-built Docker images that enable easy, production ready, and reproducible machine learning operations.  For example, you can get a "facebox" Docker image from Machine Box for facial recognition. When you run "facebox," you get a full JSON API that lets you to easily "teach" facebox certain people's faces, identify those faces in images, and persist the "state" of trained facial recognition models.

Experimenting with "facebox" got me thinking about how it could be integrated into some of my workflows.  In particular, I wanted to see how Machine Box images could be utilized as part of distributed data processing pipeline built with [Pachyderm](http://pachyderm.io/).  Pachyderm builds, runs, and manages pipelines, such as machine learning workflows, based on Docker images.  Thus, an integration of Machine Box images seems to be only natural.

And that's how the first (to my knowledge) distributed, Docker-ized, "Trump-finding" data pipeline came to be. In the sections below we will walk through the creation of a facial recognition pipeline that is able to find and tag the location of Donald Trump's face in images.  Actually, this pipeline could be used to identify any faces, and we will illustrate this flexibility by updating the pipeline to learn a second face, Hillary Clinton.

The below sections assume that you have a Pachyderm cluster running, that `pachctl`(the Pachyderm CLI tool) is connected to that cluster, and that you have signed up for a Machine Box key (which you can do for free).  All the code and more detailed instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/dwhitena/pach-machine-box).

**Create the pipeline inputs**:

To train our facial recognition model, identify faces in images, and tag those faces with certain labels, we need to create three "data repositories" that will be the inputs to our Pachyderm pipeline:

1. `training` - which includes images of faces that we use to "teach" facebox
2. `unidentified` - which includes images with faces we want to detect and identify
3. `labels` - which includes label images that we will overlay on the unidentified images to indicate identified faces

This can be done with `pachctl`:

```sh
➔ pachctl create-repo training
➔ pachctl create-repo unidentified
➔ pachctl create-repo labels
➔ pachctl list-repo
NAME                CREATED             SIZE

➔ cd ../../labels/

➔ pachctl put-file labels master -c -r -f .
➔ cd ../unidentified/
➔ ls

➔ pachctl put-file unidentified master -c -r -f .
➔ pachctl list-repo

training            7 minutes ago       486.2 KiB
```

**Train, or "teach," facebox**:

Next, we create a Pachyderm pipeline stage that will take the `training` data as input, provide those training images to facebox, and output the "state" of a trained model.  This is done by providing Pachyderm with a pipeline spec, [train.json](https://github.com/dwhitena/pach-machine-box/blob/master/pipelines/train.json).  This pipeline spec specifies the Docker image to use for data processing, the commands to execute in that Docker container, and what data is input to the pipeline.  

In our particular case, `train.json` specifies that we should use an image based on the facebox image from Machine Box and execute a number of cURL commands to post the training data to facebox.  Once those training images are provided to and processed by facebox, we specify another cURL command to export the state of the facebox model (for use later in our pipeline).

We are using a little bash magic here to perform these operations.  However, it is very possible that, in the future, Machine Box will provide a more standardized command line implementation for these sorts of use cases.

```sh
create-MB-pipeline.sh  identify.json  tag.json  train.json
➔ ./create-MB-pipeline.sh train.json 
➔ pachctl list-pipeline

➔ pachctl list-repo

```

As you can see the output of this pipeline is a `.facebox` file that contained the trained state of our facebox model.

**Use the trained facebox to identify faces**:

We then launch another Pachyderm pipeline, based on an [identify.json](https://github.com/dwhitena/pach-machine-box/blob/master/pipelines/identify.json) pipeline specification, to identify faces within the `unidentified` images.  This pipeline will take the persisted state of our model in `model` along with the `unidentified` images as input.  It will also execute cURL commands to interact with facebox, and it will output indications of identified faces to JSON files, one per `unidentified` image.

```sh
➔ ./create-MB-pipeline.sh identify.json

➔ pachctl list-file identify master

image2.json         file                347 B
```

If we look at the JSON output for, e.g., `image1.jpg`, we can see that there is a portion of the file that clearly identifies Donald Trump in the image along with the location and size of his face in the image:

```
{
	"success": true,
	"facesCount": 13,
	"faces": [
		...
		...
		{
			"rect": {
				"top": 175,
				"left": 975,
				"width": 108,
				"height": 108
			},
			"id": "58ff31510f7707a01fb3e2f4d39f26dc",
			"name": "trump",
			"matched": true
		},
		...
		...
	]
}
```

**Tagging identified faces in the images**:

We are most of the way there! We have identified Trump in the `unidentified` images, but the JSON output isn't the most visually appealling.  As such, let's overlay a label on the images at the location of Trump's face.  

To do this, we can use a [simple Go program](https://github.com/dwhitena/pach-machine-box/blob/master/tagimage/main.go) to draw the label image on the `unidentified` image at the appropriate location.  This part of the pipeline is specified by a [tag.json](https://github.com/dwhitena/pach-machine-box/blob/master/pipelines/tag.json) pipeline specification, and can be created as follows:

```sh
➔ pachctl create-pipeline -f tag.json

tagged_image2.jpg   file                34.35 KiB           
```

As you can see, we now have two "tagged" versions of the images in the output `tag` data repository.  If we get these images, we can see that... Boom! Our Trump finder works:

**Teaching a new face, updating the output**:

Our pipeline isn't restricted to Trump or any one face.  Actually, we can teach facebox another face by updating our `training`.  Moreover, becauce Pachyderm verions your data and know what data is new, it can automatically update all our results once facebox learns the new face:

```sh
➔ cd ../data/train/faces2/
